{{% param "product.abbrev" %}} is a cloud-native syslog-ng distribution by [Axoflow](https://axoflow.com).

This documentation is originally based on the [syslog-ng Open Source Edition documentation](https://github.com/balabit/syslog-ng-ose-guides/commit/2f4a52ee61d1ea9ad27cb4f3168b95408fddfdf2) for version 3.38 and is used in compliance with the terms of [The syslog-ng Open Source Edition Documentation License]({{< relref "/documentation-license/_index.md" >}}). We are continuously working on it to keep it up-to-date with the latest released version of the [`syslog-ng` project](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/) (currently {{% param "product.techversion" %}}).

In compliance with the above license, `syslog-ng` is used only to refer to the binary of the application, or in filenames, pathnames, and similar technical terms. For all other references, we use the AxoSyslog name.

New files and modifications compared to the [syslog-ng Open Source Edition documentation](https://github.com/balabit/syslog-ng-ose-guides/commit/2f4a52ee61d1ea9ad27cb4f3168b95408fddfdf2) are under the copyright of Axoflow, and licensed under Apache License 2.0, except for using the Axoflow and AxoSyslog trademarks.
